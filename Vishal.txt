Collision Mania:

A multiplayer game(currently for 2 players) which involves combined gameplay on a single device.

Gameplay:-

2 objects translate from the 2 sides of the device and collide at the centre where a visual barrier exists to hinder visibility of objects to the players. The player who clicks the button first when the balls collides wins the round. If button is pressed beforehand the other player wins. The time of translation is varied programatically at runtime. The EASY mode of the game(ready by now) involves a linear trajectory. The HARD mode involves a curved trajectory of the objects.
